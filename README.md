Hello!

`Main` class is the runnable constatins the main method. 

`Main` class also contains the method `public String uniqueCharatersString(String str)` which given a String str returns a new String without any duplicates.

`MainTest` is the testing class.

The following tests were implemented:
- Basic string
- Empty string
- Null string
- Single duplicated character
- String with no duplicates
- String with only white spaces
- String with white spaces and duplicated characters
- String with special duplicated characters
- String with unicode characters (emojis)

Thank you!
